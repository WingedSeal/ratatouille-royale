- Name: *Ratatouille Royale*

*Ratatouille Ratatouille* (or *Ratroyale*) is a turn-based strategy board game utilizing cards on a hexagonal grid. The game supports two gameplay modes: player versus AI or player versus player. The primary objective is to destroy all enemy Lairs. Victory is achieved when all opposing Lairs have been eliminated.

Each turn, players are allocated a resource called "crumbs." All in-game actions require crumbs to execute. Crumbs do not accumulate between turns and any unused crumbs are forfeited at the end of each round. Players are permitted to perform actions in any order, provided they possess sufficient crumbs.
